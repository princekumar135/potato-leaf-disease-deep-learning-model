This project involved building a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the early detection and classification of potato leaf diseases. The model is capable of identifying conditions such as early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves. Using TensorFlow, the model was trained on a collected and preprocessed image dataset, achieving high accuracy in its predictions. The research, which focuses on deep learning solutions for agriculture, was presented at the IEEE International Conference (ICCAMS) in 2025.
